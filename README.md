# Python Satellite Data Visualizer

A Python tool for visualizing satellite positions from using TLE (two-line element set) formatted data using matplotlib

This project is a fork of the code provided on Reddit by /u/chknoodle_aggie in the thread https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3gwzjr/using_pyephem_i_just_plotted_every_tleinfo/

TLE data is sourced from from http://www.tle.info/

More about TLE at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set

Note: this is developed and tested using Python on Windows, but as long as the same libraries are available in your OS this should work there as well.
