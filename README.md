# Satellite Data Visualizer

A Python 2.7+/3.4+ tool for visualizing satellite positions from using TLE (two-line element set) formatted data using matplotlib

This project is a fork of the code provided on Reddit by /u/chknoodle_aggie in the thread https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3gwzjr/using_pyephem_i_just_plotted_every_tleinfo/

This project also includes elements of the Python 3 port of this code by pklaus as published at https://gist.github.com/pklaus/469e603b105905170992

TLE data is sourced from http://www.tle.info/

More about TLE at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set

Note: This is developed and tested using Python 2.7 and 3.4 on Windows, but as long as the same libraries are available in your OS this should work there as well.
